You've reached the personal (micro) blog of Ryan Tiffany. This site will mainly contain small posts similar to something like Tumblr. Expect to see lots of music and video links along with the occassional rant about anything and everything that is on my mind. 

You can also find me haunting the following places around the internet:

[the tinylab](https://tinylab.info) - This is another site I keep. If you like macOS and Nix tutorials, feel free to give it a click.
