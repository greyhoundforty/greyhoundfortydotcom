I've been running the iOS 11 beta since the second version and somehow I just learned about this cool trick for taking notes without unlocking your phone. This new feature is called Instant Notes. To get this setup you need to go to Settings > Control Center > Customize and click the green + to move the Notes app up to the Include list.

With the control portion sorted now you need to dive back in to Settings.  From the home screen click on Settings > Notes > Scroll Down and click on Access Notes from the Lock Screen. Here you can customize options like whether or not to create a new note or resume the last note you were editing. You can also choose how long a recently added note is accessible from the lock screen.

To start using Instant Notes from the Lock Screen simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen and tap the Notes button.
