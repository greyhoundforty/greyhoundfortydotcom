I've been running the iOS 11 beta since the second version and somehow I just learned about this cool trick for taking notes without unlocking your phone. This new feature is called Instant Notes. To get this setup you need to go to Settings > Control Center > Customize and click the green + to move the Notes app up to the Include list.

With the control portion sorted now you need to dive back in to Settings.  From the home screen click on Settings > Notes > Scroll Down and click on Access Notes from the Lock Screen. Here you can customize options like whether or not to create a new note or resume the last note you were editing. You can also choose how long a recently added note is accessible from the lock screen. <br>

To start using Instant Notes from the Lock Screen simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen and tap the Notes button.
