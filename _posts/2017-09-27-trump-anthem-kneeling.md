I am often very confused when people say that kneeling during the National Anthem is showing disrespect to our country or military. It of course does not help when you have our Orange Muffin and Chief constantly conflating a non-violent protest about racial injustice with disrespecting the United States. I would argue that the military is there to fight and sacrifice exactly for the ability to protest. Go ask the North Koreans if they have the right to stand up and  criticize the police force or government. Is that the example we want to look towards? 

Trump is someone that took much too long to distance himself from the likes of David Duke and argued that some of the Nazi/White supremacists in Charlottesville were  “nice people”.  People chanting “Jews will not replace us” somehow garnered more sympathy from the President than athletes kneeling to bring attention to a serious issue. To those people he said they should be fired. “Get that son of a bitch off the field”. 

He clearly does not see one of the roles of the presidency to include bringing people together. He has repeatedly used his power and reach to help fuel an “us vs them” mentality. The conversations around the President as well as the protests have lost all nuance now. It does not feel like we can have a rational conversation about anything political these days. This is in no way a criticism of just the right. The left has become equally as bad at not reaching across the aisle. I get that sometimes it is easy to mock Trump voters, but has the left opened a dialog with these folks to really find out the reason they voted for Trump? While for some I am sure it was a response to having a black man in the oval office for 8 years, I cannot bring myself to believe that is a majority of the country. Maybe I am being naive, but I don’t think we (on the left) should dismiss the Trump voters out of hand. 

You don’t have to like Colin Kaepernick. You don’t have to like how he is protesting, but he was never protesting our flag or the country at large. He was not insulting the military or calling for police to be killed. He stated up front that he was kneeling as a protest to bring attention to the violence and racial injustice against the African-American community at large.
