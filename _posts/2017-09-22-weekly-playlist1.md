Welcome to the first in my weekly series of Spotify playlists. The idea here is to create a playlist of 8-10 songs every week. I listen to a ton of music but I also sometimes get stuck in a rut and listen to the same thing on repeat for several days. I am using this weekly series as a good way to listen to more music and highlight the tracks I really liked during the week.
This weeks playlist covers some new tunes by Arcade Fire and The National as well as some of my all time favorites.
