We find ourselves again having to grapple with a needless loss of life. The mass shooting in Las Vegas comes roughly 1 year after the previous /deadliest mass/ shooting in American history. Today people are waking up without fathers and mothers, without brothers and sisters, and without sons and daughters. I cannot fathom the grief these people must be dealing with and will continue to deal with for the rest of their lives. 

Perhaps what is even sadder is that many of us could predict the talking points we would see immediately following the shooting. The chorus of "Now is not the time to talk about gun control," rang out on Twitter, Facebook, and even from the [White House press secretary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/02/white-house-now-is-not-the-time-to-talk-about-gun-control-but-if-you-look-to-chicago/?utm_term=.c605218b0243). I don't like that the cynic in me knew the response was coming yet was not immediately outraged when it did. To be honest I went kind of numb to the whole thing for much of yesterday. I had co-workers who were in Las Vegas for a conference and once I knew they were okay, my mind threw up this protective shield and tried to keep thoughts about the tragedy behind a curtain. I knew they were there but they were hazy and indistinct. 

This morning I woke up feeling differently. As I sat with my coffee I scrolled through Twitter and saw another "Now is not the timeâ€¦" responses and my heart just sank. If now is not the time to talk about it, when will be the time? Why wasn't it /the time/ after Sandy Hook? Why wasn't it /the time/ after the Pulse Night Club shooting? Why is it never the time to talk about the out of control gun culture in this country? 

Unless things in my life change dramatically I will never own a gun. I don't have any desire to have something in my house that can take a life in an instant. It's just not my thing. That is my own gun control. I understand that many citizens want to own guns, and I honestly have no problem with that. My overriding philosophy in life is /to each his own/. What I do have a tremendous problem with is the type and amount of weapons allowed to almost anyone. The Las Vegas shooter had 23 guns in his room. Why does a normal citizen need an AK-47? 

A [majority of Americans](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/22/key-takeaways-on-americans-views-of-guns-and-gun-ownership)support universal background checks, permit requirements for gun ownership and bans on the most dangerous kinds of weapons and ammunition. In fact when Connecticut passed a law that required issuing handgun permits and expanded background checks gun crimes fell by a whopping [40 percent](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302703).  The only thing stopping any real momentum on updated gun legislation is the NRA and their group of jack-booted lobbyists selling fear and buying votes. 

Honestly though, if the [death of 20 six and seven year olds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting) did nothing to move the needle, this latest shooting probably won't either.
