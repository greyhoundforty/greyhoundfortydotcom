The first time I heard [For Carl Sagan][forcarlsagan] by [Tarentel][tarentel] I had no idea it was 20+ minutes long. I simply listened to the song build slowly and grow louder and louder until it ended in a lingering wave of distortion that stayed with me all evening. I've been getting back in to post-rock, atmospheric rock or whatever folks are calling it these days and Tarentel has been at the front of the line every time I create a new playlist of spacey, meandering, instrumental rock.
